App Description

This app allows a user to search for nutrition facts of common foods and return macro-nutrients (calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat) using the Nutritionix API. The user can also use the Yelp Fusion API to search for nearby restaurants in a given location by cuisine type, and limit the number of results returned by the request. Once the user has information about what they are eating and where they are eating it, they can find out how many calories they burned (or can burn) doing a particular exercise, or set of exercises.
